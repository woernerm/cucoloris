##
# \brief Class that provides a text input area.
#
# \details Although there is already a textinput provided in Kivy, there seems to be a bug in that
# widget's cursor position (at least in kivy 2.0). If one types in text and reaches the end of a 
# non-multiline textinput, the cursor may overflow the textinput, i.e. the cursor is outside the 
# textinput widget. This is even more present, if a long text is pasted into the widget. Then, 
# the cursor will be way outside the widget. To work around that issue, this class inherits from 
# Kivy's textinput and overwrites the necessary function. <br/>
# The cursor position is compared with the position of the right border of the textinput. If the
# cursor is right of the textinput, the cursor is moved to the left and to the right. This will put the
# cursor back into the confines of the textinput. Since the movement is first left, then right, there
# will be no movement in sum.
